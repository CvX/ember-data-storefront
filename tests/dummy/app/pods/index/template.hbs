    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>Ember Data is a powerful and flexible data-loading library, but that flexibility doesn't always make it easy to do the right thing. As your app grows, it become harder and harder to keep track of all of your data.</p>

    <p>Here are some common problems that show up while building apps with Ember Data:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Missing data.</strong> It's not always clear whether all the data has been loaded for a given state of your application, especially as the number of app states compounds. Incomplete or missing data can cause problems when visiting routes, rendering components, or performing transforms on model relationships.</li>
      <li><strong>Flashing templates.</strong> Lazily-loaded data can cause your template to unexpectedly flash during a render, making your UI disorienting.</li>
      <li><strong>Excessive network requests.</strong> The <code>n+1</code> templating bug can cause your app to make unnecessary AJAX requests that slow down your app.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>While you can re-solve each of these issues on your own, Storefront makes them preventable and easy to fix. And each API can be used separately, so you only opt-in to what you need.</p>
